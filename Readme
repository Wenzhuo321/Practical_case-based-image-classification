This project focuses on reproducing the methodology described in a specific research paper（https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Donnelly_Deformable_ProtoPNet_An_Interpretable_Image_Classifier_Using_Deformable_Prototypes_CVPR_2022_paper.html）. The process begins with testing the provided code on a bird dataset to establish baseline results. Subsequently, the same methodology is applied to a dog picture dataset to evaluate its adaptability across different types of image data. Finally, the project culminates in adapting the approach to a medical-related dataset, requiring modifications to the model's architecture to suit the unique characteristics of medical imagery.
