#This project focuses on reproducing the methods described in a specific research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05946). The process begins by testing the provided code on a bird dataset to establish baseline results. Subsequently, the same method is applied to a dog image dataset (http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) and a pockerman dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification) to evaluate the adaptability of the model to different types of image data. Finally, the project ultimately adapts the method to medical-related datasets, requiring modifications to the model's architecture to accommodate the unique characteristics of medical images.
